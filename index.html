                  <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Interviews</h5>
                    The first step in our research process was to begin interviewing People who had been through therapy before or were seeking therapy. The idea here was to ask open ended questions so that the User could go in depth about their troubles and experiences. Questions in the interviews were based on three categories: Experiences seeking therapy, Experiences during therapy, and Social Stigma surrounding therapy. A common theme among our interviews was the length of time it took to find a therapist, let alone a therapist that the interviewee felt comfortable with. Additionally, many did not know where to start their search for therapist, leading to demotivation. 
                    <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Survey</h5>
                    After finding common themes withing our interviews, we created a survey online using google forms, which was sent out to nearly 70 people. During this survey, we found more common themes within the base of people seeking therapy. These included the lack of social support and uncertainty of where to go for therapy. Additionally, many of those who took the survey noted that they were often demotivated from contacting a therapist due to the large amount of medical forms and documents required to begin the procces. For these reasons, we felt it was incredibly important to create an app that would make the process of searching for a therapist easier.

              <h5 class="mt-0">Brainstorming</h5>
             After recieving the results of our survey, our team began brainstorming ideas which could be implemented into the app. One of the first methods we used was creating an empathy map, which would layout our users' various needs, painpoints, and general goals. Following this, we established creative ideas using the "I like, I wish, What if" Method of creating features. Some of our most important features were gotten from this brainstorming session, such as the AI chat bot who would help walk the user through the process, the use of only one medical form to send to all therapists, and the Therapist search parameters.
             <h5 class="mt-0">Design</h5>
            With brainstorming out of the way, we were able to quickly move on to designing the general layout of the app. This was achieved using paper and pencil layouts to create the general path users would take throughout the app. The idea was to make the path as eay to navigate as possible to avoid confusing new users and retaining as many users as possible.
